22/10/20204

17:11 Implemented improved mouse input where paddle moves towards mouse depending on its location compared to itself.
17:39 Working on screen shake still
17:45 Screen flips when hit, starting on real screen shake now. 
17:56 bug found in mouse movement.
18:05 Mouse bug fixed where mouse was affecting movement when not intended. Mouse movement still could be refined but moving back to screen shake.
18:20 basic screen shake added
18:30 screenshake function completed
18:53 bug fixes - forward declaration in ball cpp and initial view fixed
19:00 screenshake added to more ball collisions
19:02 looking over powerup implementation, plan to add more powerups
